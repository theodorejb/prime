# Prime

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/theodorejb/prime.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/theodorejb/prime)

Prime is a tiny library I made for fun, primarily for solving several
[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems.
Perhaps others will find it useful as well.

## Development

Prime is written in TypeScript. After editing files, run `npm install` to
compile everything and create a browser test bundle. Run `npm test` to ensure all
the tests pass, or use `test/browser/index.html` to run the tests in a browser.
